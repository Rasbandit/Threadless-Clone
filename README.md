## Technology Used
The Site is crated using a SANE stack. The Node Server handles the requesting of data from a database that houses all the images used for the products including pricing and sizes.
On the catalog page I used Directives to show each product and then used NG-Repeat to show all producs that are applicable based on the filtering done by the user.
The user can add items to the cart and check out using Stripe.JS.
